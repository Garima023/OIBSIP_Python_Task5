# Task 5 - Client-Server Chat Application (OIBSIP Internship)

This project is part of my Oasis Infobyte Internship (OIBSIP).  
In this task, I created a *Client-Server Chat Application* using Python socket programming.

---

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how two programs (a client and a server) can communicate over a network using Python's socket library.

- The *server* waits for incoming connections.  
- The *client* connects to the server.  
- Once connected, they can exchange messages until terminated.  

---

## Features
- Server listens for client requests.  
- Client connects to the server and establishes a session.  
- Real-time two-way communication between client and server.  
- Simple and lightweight design using Python sockets.

## Files
- server.py → Contains server-side implementation.  
- client.py → Contains client-side implementation.
